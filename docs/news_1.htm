        Zurkani Vardari speech (1st Row most right)<p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">It is short sighted and naive to think that if we break
        the television set and ban Western music that our kids will be saved
        from the perils of the popular Western culture, although these measures
        maybe of some&nbsp; benefit if taken early enough in the child's life.
        What can we do? One answer is the Islamic education for all Muslim
        children, in a safe and moral environment. Full time Islamic schools are
        one of the clear options we have available for us for this purpose. But
        we have to compete with well-funded public schools and lavishly equipped schools run by other
        religious communities," said Dr. Safdar H. Chadda, Director of the Muslim Unity Foundation Inc. while addressing a well attended Seerat-Un-Nabi Conference at the Roosevelt Hotel.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><br>
Most of our children are becoming victims to the popular American culture. They often listen to the music of "hard rock" groups and rap artists. They read magazines such as "Vibe" and "Source"; watch videos of contemporary pop artists and see movies that contain
        exten- sive violence and sexual content, said Dr. Chadda.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><br>
Dr. Chadda quoted Dr. Dobson, an American writer and radio commentator, who said that "
        unfortunately, those spiritual concepts on which this nation was built are
        being superseded now by
        philosophies and judgements that are rooted in atheism. The name of Ciod has been removed from every vestige of public life, as though He were a cancerous growth that threatened the life of the organism. This situation is critical and must be addressed because the future of the Muslim community is in
        jeopardy. While I do not condemn all aspects of the popular Western
        culture, I do understand its inherent dangers, particularly to Muslim&nbsp;&nbsp;youth.
        Although young Muslim are expected to live moral and ethical lives,
        there are limited cultural alternatives to counter act negative
        influences, Dr. Chadda added.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><br>
        Muslim presence in the West of- fm Muslims and the West a unique
        opportunity to understand each other, come into serious existential
        dialogue, and produce a model community for the rest of humanity, Dr.
        Chadda explained.<br>
        In conclusion Dr. Chadda said that the Muslim Unity Foundation (MUF) is
        a nonprofit organization whichhas taken an initiative to sup- port
        Muslim full-time schools fi- nancially. These schools may pro- vide a
        safe and supportive environment for our kids. Saving our youth should
        be our national priority. We have taken on this gigantous challenge
        and need your moral and financial support. Let us join together to
        save our future genemtions.<br>
        This Secrat-Un-Nabi Conference was organized by the Muslim Unity
        Foundation, which was established last year with a main objective to

        education, and to admit maximum number of students to make them good
        citizens of the United States. The conference was addressed by Imam Ayoub
        Abdul Eaqi of Masjid Al-Tawbeed; Mr. Mohammed Cheriff, Khateeb Dar-ul-Islah,
